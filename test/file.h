Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived \
in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. \
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived \
and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to \
dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that \
that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. \
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- \
this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above \
our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, \
but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here \
to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for \
us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we \
take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- \
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, \
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, \
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.";
